Installing the driver (prior to using the actuator)
==================================================
Install the USB drivers on the PC, before plugging in the USB cable.

The USB interface will appear as a virtual COM port.


Configure the Actuator (prior to using the actuator)
==================================================
Ideally this should be done before we do software testing.

Option 1: 
Suggest to do so using a Terminal program like Putty.
Enter commands and install the valves.
Follow the instructions on page 6 of the manual.

Option 2:
Use the manual remote to configure.
Follow the instructions on page 22 (Appendix B).
